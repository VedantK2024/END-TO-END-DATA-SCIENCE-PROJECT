NAME :VEDANTT RAJESH KASLIKAR

INTERN ID: CTIS2307

DOMAIN: DATA SCIENCE

DURATION:4 WEEKS

MENTOR : NEELA SANTOSH

Developed  a complete data science project from data collection through model deployment using Flask or FastAPI. Deliver a functional web application showcasing the model.
What Was Done
Built an end-to-end ML system that predicts house prices based on 12 property features (area, bedrooms, bathrooms, location amenities, etc.).
Pipeline:

Data Collection - Generated synthetic dataset of 1,000 house records
Preprocessing - Performed EDA, label encoding, feature scaling, train-test split
Model Training - Trained 5 models (Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
Model Selection - Ridge Regression achieved best performance (92.33% R² accuracy)
Deployment - Built Flask web application with REST API


Technical Stack:

Python, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
Flask framework for API
HTML/CSS for web interface
Deployed on Render/Heroku

Deliverables:

 Flask application with web UI (form-based predictions)
 REST API endpoints (/api/predict, /api/health)
 Pre-trained model (92% accuracy)
 24 complete files ready for GitHub
 Live deployment capability (5 minutes to deploy)
